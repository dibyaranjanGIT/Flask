Jinja is a templating language for python. In HTML alone we can’t use variables, 
for loops, if else things like that but jinja makes it possible for us. 

It just changes our whole experience of writing in HTML and it opens up a whole lot of 
new possibilities to try. 

How to access static folder?
There are two ways to do this.
<img src=”static/img_name.png”>
With jinja we can do it like:
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img_name.png') }}">

For loop in jinja:
<ul>
{% for user in users %}
  <li><a href="{{ user.url }}">{{ user.username }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
